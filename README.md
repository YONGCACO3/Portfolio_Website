## Features

- **Hosted on AWS**: The website is reliably hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services), ensuring high availability and performance. With a CI/CD pipeline for seamless updates, any commits to the main branch trigger a new deployment.
- **DNS Management by Cloudflare**: Utilizes Cloudflare for DNS management, providing additional security and faster DNS resolution.
- **Built with Modern Technologies**: The website is developed using:
  - **JavaScript**: For dynamic and interactive user experience.
  - **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
  - **Bootstrap**: A widely-used front-end framework that simplifies the development of responsive design and a mobile-friendly layout with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Dynamic Contact Section**: Includes a server-backed messaging feature that allows users to directly send messages to me through the website. (Currently, for www.jiayonglu.com, the backend server functionality has been substituted with an email sending service.)
